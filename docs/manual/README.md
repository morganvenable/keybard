# Keybard user manual

Published at [keybard.svalboard.com/manual/](https://keybard.svalboard.com/manual/). Locally, open [index.html](index.html), or serve this directory with `python3 -m http.server 5190 --directory docs/manual` from the repository root. The manual needs no JavaScript framework, package install, external font, or network connection to read. All essential instructions remain visible without JavaScript; search, image enlargement and recording playback are enhancements. Use Print / Save as PDF for a paper copy.

## Scope and product baseline

Keybard `8d01073` (main, 2026-10-07) and Svalboard-QMK launch notes at firmware `9331eacc46`. This is an end-user walkthrough, not a claim that every firmware control, sensor, migration path or native platform has been hardware-validated.

The guide covers first-time offline exploration, a safe first connected edit, migration from supported Vial firmware, returning users, layers and the bundled layout groups, behavior authoring/assignment, pointing, settings/diagnostics, automatic backups, files/library/printing, and the read-only Trainer companion. It distinguishes board state, pending draft state and exported files throughout.

## Planned process

1. Read production sources and map three golden paths: new/offline, new/connected, and existing/returning.
2. Independently audit workflow semantics and feature coverage before drafting.
3. Capture actual application screens using the bundled QWERTY example; use explicitly identified controlled fixtures where a connected state is needed. Do not access physical boards or include personal layouts or internal board names.
4. Write a progressive walkthrough, followed by practical reference material and recovery guidance.
5. Cross-review chapters against the source, then run a separate adversarial usability/accessibility review.
6. Correct findings, check links/assets/search/navigation/illustrations at desktop and mobile sizes, verify print output, and record limitations.

## Adversarial review record

Two independent source auditors mapped the journeys and feature workflows. They drafted separate chapters, then cross-reviewed each other's material. A third reviewer inspected the assembled page in a browser at desktop and mobile sizes. The following findings changed the manual:

- Corrected stale Update/Revert wording to current Apply N Changes and Discard pending edits.
- Made Live Updating and Typing Binds a Key defaults explicit before the first connected experiment.
- Explained that switching to Live applies the queue and that ordinary typing with a selected target can reassign it.
- Corrected the export format label to `.svil (Recommended)`.
- Separated first-boot firmware migration from blocked direct legacy-file import.
- Replaced unsafe “reconnect and Retry” guidance: export a retained draft before reconnecting, because reconnection rereads the board and may discard pending edits.
- Distinguished the local library's Import from the toolbar's Import Layout; documented retained fields and capacity checks.
- Corrected immediate board-name button to Save now.
- Added Matrix Tester and printing walkthroughs; made clear neither is a restorable backup or resolved-output trace.
- Added intrinsic screenshot dimensions to prevent image loading from moving deep-linked chapters.
- Added a full-resolution image link for small screens and focus transfer after mobile navigation.

No physical board was modified to create this manual. Browser validation is not a substitute for firmware or native desktop hardware acceptance testing. Capture metadata and automated manual checks live under `evidence/`.

## Maintenance

Edit `content/start.html` and `content/features.html`, then run:

```sh
python3 docs/manual/tools/build.py
```

`index.html` is committed so the manual can be opened directly. The builder uses only the Python standard library. Capture scripts require Playwright and a Chromium installation; adjust their environment/path settings for your machine. Screenshot captions distinguish offline examples and simulated connected/native state. Re-run `tools/validate.py` after changes to content, images or navigation.

Capture scripts use Playwright’s installed Chromium by default; set `CHROMIUM_PATH` to use another executable. `tools/env.py` holds the shared settings: `KEYBARD_CAPTURE_URL` is the running Keybard development server including its base path (default `http://127.0.0.1:5173/keybard-ng/`, which `npm run dev` serves on most branches; `vite.config.ts` assigns 5170 to `main`), and `MANUAL_URL` is the manual server (default port 5190). Fixture modules are imported from the same base path. For a neutral build label in screenshots, start the dev server with `GIT_BRANCH=main` and the documented commit in `GIT_SHA`. With Playwright installed, run captures in this order: `capture.py`, `capture-editors.py`, `capture-files.py`, `capture-connected.py`, `capture-native.py`. Then rebuild and validate. Connected captures block physical HID access and inject controlled device responses.

Final acceptance passed at widths 360, 390, 768, 1280 and 1600 pixels, including search, mobile navigation, layer comparison, image enlargement, keyboard focus, stable deep links, local links, JavaScript-disabled reading and PDF generation. All eleven chapters remain readable without JavaScript. The independent usability re-review found no remaining material blocker.

## Action demonstrations

The manual includes 40 recordings of actual browser interactions, including an opening flow that opens Standard Keys and drags A directly onto Q. Recordings autoplay while visible and stop offscreen. There are no separate Pause or Open GIF controls; click-to-enlarge remains available. GIFs are the default HTML image source, and playback is enabled with either system motion preference, as requested. Print uses stills when JavaScript is enabled. Script and stylesheet URLs carry content hashes to avoid stale cached behavior.

Capture scripts require Playwright, Pillow and Chromium. Run `capture-actions.py`, `capture-walkthroughs.py`, `capture-extra.py`, `capture-overlay-action.py` and `capture-backups.py`; the walkthrough, extra and backups scripts accept individual case names. `action_recorder.py` supplies pointer movement and encoding. Each outcome is verified before saving, and evidence records the source and simulated-device boundaries. `connected-fixture.js` blocks real USB access. Native OS choosers, Windows installation and physical hardware testing remain outside browser capture.

Recording the workflows corrected the mod-tap and layer-tap instructions: assignment can clear selection, so reselect before composing. The Transparent/Blank explanation now compares the same A position in two cases and states exactly what is typed.

On `main`, the Pending (N) list opens inside the scrolling toolbar and can be clipped, so the recordings show the Pending count and Apply N Changes without opening the list.

`capture-backups.py` records Settings → Backups with the controlled test board and a fake browser clock. Two earlier snapshots are seeded through the real backup service so the list has a history; the change summaries, Unsent marker, restore review and folder writes are the application's own. The folder recording replaces the system folder chooser with an in-memory folder and checks the files Keybard writes. The native folder chooser and the browser's permission prompts (including Allow on every visit) are outside browser capture.

## Publishing

`build/manual.ts` copies `index.html`, `content/`, `assets/`, `manual.css`, `manual.js` and the PDF into `dist/manual/` after each Vite build, so the production deploy publishes it at `keybard.svalboard.com/manual/`. This README, `tools/` and `evidence/` are not published. The dev server serves the same files at `<base>manual/`. Keybard Paranoid is a single offline file and does not include the manual. The **Manual** item in Keybard's navigation opens it in a new tab.
