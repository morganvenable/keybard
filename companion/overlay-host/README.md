# Keybard Host

Keybard Host shows your Svalboard layout as a transparent overlay on your desktop. It follows the layer you're on, so you can glance at it while you type in any app. It runs in the system tray and only reads from the keyboard: it never changes your layout or flashes firmware.

You choose what the overlay looks like in the **Trainer** panel of [Keybard](https://keybard.svalboard.com).

## Install (Windows)

1. Download `KeybardHost-Windows.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/svalboard/keybard/releases) and extract the whole ZIP to a folder you'll keep.
2. Run `Start-Windows.cmd`. The first launch downloads its own copy of Python and Qt, so you need to be online. No admin rights or system changes are needed.

Keybard Host is now in your system tray, and it opens Trainer on [keybard.svalboard.com](https://keybard.svalboard.com) in your browser.

## Set up the overlay

1. In Trainer, connect your keyboard if it isn't already, and click **Connect to Keybard Host**. If the browser asks whether the site can access apps on this device, allow it. Next time it reconnects on its own.
2. Pick the board to show, if you have more than one, and set the overlay's colors, size and other options. They're saved on this computer.

Use Chrome or Edge. **Open Keybard** in the tray menu takes you back to Trainer. Offline, the Host's built-in copy of Keybard at `http://127.0.0.1:5178/` works the same way.

## Using it

- **Place it:** the overlay starts out draggable. Once it's where you want it, turn on **Click through keyboard** in Trainer or in the overlay's small menu. The grip next to the overlay stays clickable either way.
- **Tray menu:** show or hide the overlay, drag or place it at the bottom of the screen, reload the layout, open Keybard's Trainer, or quit. Closing the browser leaves the overlay running.
- **After you edit your layout in Keybard**, the overlay updates by itself about a second after the change reaches the keyboard, as long as Keybard is connected to Keybard Host (the Trainer's **Connect to Keybard Host**, once). For changes made elsewhere, choose **Reload layout** from the tray.
- **Held keys:** optionally highlight the keys you're holding. Very short taps can be missed.
- **Shift and Caps Lock** change the letters and symbols shown, using the keyboard language chosen in Keybard. This doesn't work on Wayland.

## What it doesn't do

Keybard Host never writes to the keyboard, flashes firmware or records what you type. Its control page listens only on your own computer. It takes commands only from its built-in Keybard and from keybard.svalboard.com, and each change needs a per-session token.

## Updating

Quit Keybard Host from the tray, extract the new release to a new folder, and run `Start-Windows.cmd` there. Your settings are kept, because they're stored in your user profile rather than in the app folder.

## Paranoid mode

Paranoid mode is a separate way to run Keybard Host, for people who want Keybard to have no network access at all. `Start-Paranoid.cmd` starts the Host with Keybard Paranoid, a single-file build of Keybard that can't reach the network. It ignores all websites, keybard.svalboard.com included, and opens its own Keybard in a separate browser profile that can only reach your own computer. `Open-Paranoid.cmd` opens Keybard Paranoid on its own, without the overlay. See `docs/paranoid.md` for exactly what it protects.

## Linux and macOS

Linux: copy the web build to `companion/overlay-host/web`, then run `bash companion/overlay-host/start-linux.sh`. On Wayland, placement, stacking and click-through depend on the compositor. macOS hasn't been tested.

### Linux setup

Qt's X11 plugin and Qt WebEngine need these libraries. A full Ubuntu desktop has most of them; minimal installs and WSL do not. Qt reports any missing X11 library as `xcb-cursor0`, so install the whole list:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-venv libnss3 libasound2t64 libxkbfile1 libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-icccm4 \
  libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-image0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-shape0 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

The Host reads the board through hidraw, which only root can open by default. Give the logged-in user access to Svalboard HID devices, then replug the board. The rule matches the USB IDs rather than the serial number, because current firmware no longer reports the serial that Vial's udev rule looks for.

```sh
echo 'KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="4044", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-svalboard.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=hidraw
```

Under WSL, attach the board with [usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) (`usbipd bind`, then `usbipd attach --wsl`); Windows loses the board until it is detached. If Wayland fails with `Failed to create wl_display`, set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/mnt/wslg/runtime-dir`. WSLg doesn't show the overlay under X11 (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`), so use Wayland there. If a Windows Host already uses port 5178, start the Linux Host with `--port 5179`. What works under WSLg says nothing about stacking, focus or click-through on native Ubuntu.

## For developers

### Build

From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
VITE_BASE_PATH=/ npm run build
python3 companion/overlay-host/scripts/package.py
```

This makes `dist/KeybardHost-Windows.zip`, a local test build. It isn't signed, and it doesn't include downloaded runtimes or anyone's settings.

### Test

```sh
npm test
PYTHONPATH=companion/overlay-host python3 -m unittest discover -s companion/overlay-host/tests -v
```

These don't cover moving the window, focus, click-through, fullscreen, or live layer and held-key changes on real hardware. Check those by hand.

### Publish a Windows preview

1. Update `RELEASE-NOTES.md`.
2. Run the tests above and a Windows smoke test.
3. Build with `npm run build:svalboard`, then run `python3 companion/overlay-host/scripts/package.py`.
4. In `dist`, run `sha256sum KeybardHost-Windows.zip > SHA256SUMS.txt`.
5. Tag the commit (`keybard-host-vX.Y.Z-preview.N`, or a launch tag shared with the firmware such as `vLaunch2`) and publish a GitHub prerelease with the ZIP and the checksum. Set `KEYBARD_HOST_VERSION` to the tag when packaging, so the host reports it.
6. Set `HOST_RELEASE_TAG` in `src/features/trainer/HostInstall.tsx` to the new tag, so Trainer's install link finds it. Link the tag itself, not GitHub's `latest` redirect, which skips prereleases.

Instead of steps 3–5, you can run the **Package Keybard Host preview** workflow with an existing tag. It builds a draft prerelease with both files, stamps the release and the bundled Keybard commit into the host and the release notes; test the ZIP before you publish it.
